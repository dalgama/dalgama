Iâ€™m a passionate self-taught Full Stack web developer and game implementer from Canada. My passion for Web development lies in finding new ideas and finding ways in accomplishing them. I find it interesting to implement website services that I find interesting and to see what steps it requires the reach the end product. I put a lot of effect into the experience and code quality of my work to practice good coding practices making my code easy to understand by other coders and developers.

I am an open minded developer who is willing to give anything some suggest building a try and lessening to peoples ideas about what more the internet can offer to them personal. This helps me create ideas of what I can work on next during my free time.

I really enjoy teaching people, conveying my knowledge and make sure to go that extra mile to make sure whoever I am teaching really understands the reasoning behind the steps theyâ€™re doing or the steps I mention.
